STSMs are intended especially, but not solely, for young researchers.</p><p>An STSM should specifically contribute to the scientific objectives of the COST Action &quot;LEAD-ME&quot;, while enabling those partaking in the missions to establish new partnerships, learn new techniques, gain access to specific data, instruments and / or methods not available in their own institutions / organisations.</p><h3>Who can apply?</h3><p>STSMs are open for PhDs, PostDocs, and advanced career researchers employed at institutions in countries participating in &quot;LEAD-ME&quot;, or at approved institutions. STSMs must be performed between COST countries - researchers cannot apply for an STSM within their own country.</p><p>Priority will be given to Early Career Investigators (ECI) (maximum 8 years since obtaining their PhD at the time of application) and PhD students working on socio-technical aspects of the collaborative economy.</p><p>Particular consideration will also be given to candidates moving from/to COST Inclusiveness Target Countries (ITCs), which include Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Republic of Serbia and Turkey.</p><p>International COST participants may host STSM researchers from European COST countries but may not apply for STSMs themselves.</p><p>Awards throughout the annual grant period will be made to support scientific excellence, and to support a variety of researchers in terms of gender, career stage, affiliation, and nationality.</p><h3>What can you apply for?</h3><p>You can apply for a short term scientific mission of the duration between 5 and 90 days (and up to 180 days if the applicant is an ECI). The STSM will be a fixed grant to cover part of the travel expenses and living allowance. The cost of research materials is not eligible for consideration as part of the grant.</p><p>Please note that the awarded grant will be paid only after the STSM has been completed – therefore the applicant must have approval and prior financial support e.g., from their own institution.</p><p>The following funding conditions apply and must be respected:</p><ul><li>up to a max of EUR3500 in total can be afforded to each successful STSM applicant;</li><li>up to a max of EUR160 per day can be afforded for accommodation &amp; meal expenses;</li><li>for ECIs, a max amount of EUR3500 can be afforded to the Grantee for STSMs with a duration of between 91 &amp; 180 days</li><li>STSM activities must occur in their entirety within the dates specified in this call.</li></ul><p>STSM awards may be combined with other funding sources, but these must be acknowledged in the application.</p><p>In your application, you will have to describe the goal of the proposed STSM, how it contributes to the scientific remit of the COST Action &quot;LEAD-ME&quot;, the planned expenses and the outputs planned as result of the STSM. For ECIs, two support letters by advanced career researchers will be required.</p><p>For detailed rules regarding eligibility and financial support, please see the <a href="https://www.cost.eu/funding/documents-guidelines/">relevant sections of the COST guidelines</a>.</p><h3>When can you apply?</h3><p>Calls for STSM applications are currently open and will be addressed on a per application basic. We are likely to move to a series of call dates later in the COST action.</p><h3>How can you apply?</h3><p>This is a step-by-step guide to applying for an STSM and the criteria by which STSM applications will be assessed. More in-depth information can be found at the <a href="https://www.cost.eu/uploads/2022/12/COST-094-21-Annotated-Rules-for-COST-Actions-Level-C-V1.3.pdf">COST Annotated Rules</a>.

(including a list of academic publications – if applicable).</li></ul><ol start="6"><li>The “LEAD-ME” STSM committee organises assessment of the STSM proposal: STSM selection team assess the proposal (see ‘STSM Selection Criteria’) – may seek expert but impartial advice to inform their decision. If approved, the STSM coordinator sends application and approval to Grant Holder &amp; Action Chair for final check.</li><li>The Grant Holder sends the applicant a grant letter to sign and return. The STSM should not be started until this letter has been signed and returned.</li><li>After the STSM, the investigator submits a scientific report to the STSM Host and STSM coordinator within 30 days of completing the STSM. This must include: the purpose of the mission; description of work carried out; description of main results/outputs; plan of future collaborations with Host (if applicable); planned publications resulting from STSM (if applicable); confirmation of successful STSM by Host.</li><li>STSM Coordinator and Action Chair approve the final report.

The procedure is as follows:</p><ul><li>ITC Conference Grants Call is launched by LEAD-ME ITC Conference Grants Manager (stating all relevant details of application (WG of reference) and deadline). Please note that current call is ongoing and the applications can be submitted at any time.</li><li>After the deadline, a Committee of Reviewers (LEAD-ME Editorial Committee and ITC Conference Grants Manager) pre-evaluates all submitted applications in the context of their compatibility and relevance with the topic of the Action. The committee also checks if the applicant is a PhD candidate or ECI, and if he/she represents an ITC country.</li><li>The result of the pre-approval is the ranking list and the actual number of applications to be funded is determined by the available budget. The ITC Conference Grants Manager confirms available funding with the Grant Manager, and informs successful Applicants about the result of the pre-approval.</li><li>The Applicants that were successful during the pre-approval must then formally submit their applications via e-COST.</li><li>Action Chair approves the applications that has been successfully pre-approved.</li><li>The Grant Holder sends the grant letter.</li></ul><h3>Pre-evaluation</h3><p>Your application will be first evaluated by the Editorial Committee and by the ITC Conference Grants Manager. Then, if the remaining budget allows to provide funding it will be submitted for approval by the Action Chair. Priority will be given to applications that support the objectives of the Working Packages.</p><p>It is expected that each ITC grantee will send a copy of their presentation/poster/paper to the ITC Conference Grants Manager of the LEAD-ME Action. It will be then disseminated using the official LEAD-ME website, social media, etc. The material must be submitted to the ITC Conference Grants Manager by email shortly after the conference. Photographic material from the conference (e.g. the Applicant with the LEAD-ME logo in background) will be requested.</p><p>With any further questions please contact <a href="mailto:c.j.hughes@salford.ac.uk">Chris Hughes</a> (ITC Grant coordinator)</p><h1 class="padtop32">Past Calls</h1><h2>2nd Call for applications: LEAD-ME short-term scientific missions (STSMs)</h2><p>Short-term scientific missions are exchange visits for researchers within the LEAD-ME Action.
